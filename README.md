Little Standards — local static copy

This folder contains a small static replica of the Framer page so you can run it locally.

How to run

1. From the repository root, open a terminal and run:

   cd framer-site-local
   npm start

2. Then open http://localhost:5000 in your browser.

Notes
- The page is a hand-made static copy with a client-side expense list stored in localStorage.
- If you want to serve on a different port, set PORT in the environment before running, e.g. `PORT=3000 npm start`.
