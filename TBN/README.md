# Framer-site (scaffolded port)

This is a small Vite + React scaffold to port the Framer site at https://teenbusinessnetwork.framer.website/ into a maintainable codebase.

Quick start:

```bash
cd framer-site
npm install
npm run dev
```

What I scaffolded:
- `src/` React app with `Header` and `Hero` components
- `framer-motion` is included for animations
- `public/assets/` intended for images exported from Framer (place assets there)

Next steps I can take:
- Download and copy images/fonts from the Framer site into `public/assets/`
- Convert additional sections into components and wire routes
- Polish CSS to match the original exactly
